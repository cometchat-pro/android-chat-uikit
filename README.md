# CometChat Vue UI Kit

The CometChat Android UI Kit provides a pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into an existing or a new app.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio 
- Android Device or emulator with Android version 6.0 or above.
- Java 8 or above.
- Sign up for a [CometChat](https://app.cometchat.com/) account to get your app credentials: _`App ID`_, _`Region`_, and _`Auth Key`_

## Getting Started
To set up CometChat Android UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.

2. **Create an Application**: After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.

3. **Check the [Key Concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/android-uikit/key-concepts)** to understand the basic components of CometChat.

4. **Refer to the [Integration Steps](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/android-uikit/integration)** in our documentation to integrate the UI Kit into your Vue app.
